Book: Elocuent in Javascript
Book online: http://youdontknowjs.com

He is going to go about a book content, and starts very early, and he will be
picking it up.

He teaches for a living. He is available for hire, to teach. He seems pretty cool
maybe i could learn more from this guy. For sure he is focused in Javascript

He has a book series called You do not know Javascript

He also do a fair amount of open source.

Projects he has built:
• LABjs
• grips: templating engine that uses an interesting approach. grips is using a
templating.
• asynquence: async programming. Different concepts that are packaged in this
library.

Lots of resources to learn from.

I like his approach because he is talking about that everyone is learning how to
get a feature, but his appraoch is to learn a programming language to make proper
user of the language

/* Executing a program
Javascript started compiling very early. Javascript is not an interpreted
language. It is compiled.
It does multiple passes. First to understand a program and then it executes a
second pass. What matter is that Javascript get compiled for error checking

/* Practice Coding
Chrome can use the console from the dev tools or we can run node to execute the
file. Done take it for granted run the program yourself.
